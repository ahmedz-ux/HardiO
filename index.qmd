# üé≤ Simulation Challenge - Monte Carlo Analysis

## Challenge Overview

**Your Mission:** Create a comprehensive Quarto document that simulates one or two investment strategies, analyzes the results, and demonstrates your ability to present counter-intuitive findings compellingly. Then render the document to HTML and deploy it via GitHub Pages from a new repository called "simulationChallenge."

::: {.callout-warning}
## ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance ‚Üí Awareness ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## The Investment Game üéØ

### Original Game Strategy

::: {#exm-ErgodicityEconomicsExample}
Imagine you are offered the following game and given a $1,000 budget in a special account to play the game: I will flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, we increase your account's balance by 50%; if it comes up tails, we reduce your account's balance by 40%. We are not only doing this once, but we will do it once per year until you turn 55. When you turn 55, you will receive the balance in your account.

### Generative DAG Model for the Investment Game

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
#| include: false
import daft

# Create the DAG directly without custom class
investmentDAG = daft.PGM(dpi=150, alternate_style="outer")

# Initial wealth (deterministic)
investmentDAG.add_node("W0", "Initial Wealth\n$W_0 = 1000$", x=4, y=2.5, aspect=5.4, 
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Time t nodes  
investmentDAG.add_node("Ct", "Coin Flip t\n$C_t \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(0.5)$", x=0, y=1, aspect=4, scale = 1.6,
                      plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})
investmentDAG.add_node("Wt", "\nWealth t\n$W_t = 1.5 \\times W_{t-1}$ if $C_t = 1$\n$W_t = 0.6 \\times W_{t-1}$ if $C_t = 0$\n", x=4, y=1, scale = 1.6, aspect=4,
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Add edges showing the relationships
investmentDAG.add_edge("W0", "Wt")
investmentDAG.add_edge("Ct", "Wt")

# Add plate around time-dependent nodes
investmentDAG.add_plate([-2, 0.5, 7.8, 1.0], label="t = 1, ..., N", shift=-0.1)
```

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| label: fig-investment-dag
#| fig-cap: Generative DAG model for the investment game showing how wealth evolves over time through coin flips
#| echo: false
investmentDAG.show()

## Grading Rubric üéì

### Questions to Answer for 75% Grade on Challenge

1. **Expected Value Analysis:** What is the "expected value" of your account balance after 1 coin flip for the original game?

2. **Expectation vs. Reality:** Is the expected value positive or negative? Do you expect your account to be worth more or less than $1,000 based on this result?

3. **Single Simulation:** Run one simulation showing the dynamics of your account balance over time. Make an object-oriented matplotlib OR ggplot2 plot showing your simulated account balance over time (i.e. as you age). Comment on the results, are you happy?

### Questions to Answer for 85% Grade on Challenge

4. **Multiple Simulations:** Run 100 simulations modelling the dynamics of your account balance over time. Make an object-oriented matplotlib OR ggplot2 plot showing a probability distribution of the 100 simulatedaccount balance at age 55. Comment on the results, are you happy? Why or why not?

### Questions to Answer for 95% Grade on Challenge

5. **Probability Analysis:** Based on the 100 simulations above, what is the probability that your account balance will be greater than $1,000 at age 55?

### Questions to Answer for 100% Grade on Challenge

6. **Strategy Comparison:** Run 100 simulations for the modified game strategy shown below in @exm-ErgodicityEconomicsExampleModified. What is the probability that your account balance will be greater than $10,000 at age 55? Is this probability higher or lower than the probability in the original game?

### Modified Game Strategy

::: {#exm-ErgodicityEconomicsExampleModified}
Imagine you are offered the following game and given a $1,000 budget in a special account to play the game: I will flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, we increase your bet by 50%; if it comes up tails, we reduce your bet by 40%. You must bet exactly 50% of your current account balance on each flip, and this 50% is locked in for each round. We are not only doing this once, but we will do it once per year until you turn 55. When you turn 55, you will receive the balance in your account.

## Essential Simulation Concepts üéØ {#sec-simulation-concepts}

Before diving into the challenge, let's review the key simulation concepts you'll need. These examples will prepare you for the investment game analysis.

### 1. Simple Simulation: Coin Flip Game

Let's start with a basic coin flip simulation to understand the mechanics:

#### Generative DAG Model for the Simple Coin Flip Game

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
#| include: false
import daft

# Create the DAG for simple coin flip game
simpleCoinDAG = daft.PGM(dpi=150, alternate_style="outer")

# Coin flip (stochastic node)
simpleCoinDAG.add_node("X", "Coin Flip\n$X \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(0.5)$", x=1, y=1, aspect=4,
                      plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Winnings (deterministic node)
simpleCoinDAG.add_node("W", "Winnings\n$W = 100$ if $X = 1$ else $-100$", x=1, y=0, aspect=5.4,
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Add edge showing the relationship
simpleCoinDAG.add_edge("X", "W")
```

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| label: fig-simple-coin-dag
#| fig-cap: Generative DAG model for the simple coin flip game showing the relationship between coin flip outcome and winnings
#| echo: false
simpleCoinDAG.show()
```

**Key Difference from Investment Game:** Unlike the investment game DAG (@fig-investment-dag) which models wealth evolution over multiple time periods with multiplicative changes, this simple coin flip DAG represents a single-period game with additive winnings. The investment game shows how wealth compounds over time ($W_t = 1.5 \times W_{t-1}$ or $W_t = 0.6 \times W_{t-1}$), while this simple game shows fixed winnings ($W = +100$ or $W = -100$) based on a single coin flip outcome.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### R

```{r}
#| label: simple-sim-r
#| fig-cap: R simulation of coin flip game
#| echo: true

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Number of simulations
n_sims <- 10

# Create simulation data
sim_data <- tibble(
  sim_num = 1:n_sims,
  coin_flip = rbinom(n = n_sims, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
) %>%
  mutate(
    winnings = if_else(coin_flip == 1, 100, -100)
  )

# Display results
sim_data
```

### Python

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| label: simple-sim-python
#| fig-cap: Python simulation of coin flip game
#| echo: true

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Set seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(123)

# Number of simulations
n_sims = 10

# Step 1: Draw coin flips (stochastic node)
X = np.random.binomial(n=1, p=0.5, size=n_sims)

# Step 2: Compute winnings (deterministic node)
W = np.where(X == 1, 100, -100)

# Combine into data frame
sim_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'sim_num': range(1, n_sims + 1),
    'coin_flip': X,
    'winnings': W
})

# Display results
sim_data
```

:::

### 2. Time-Series Simulation: Account Balance Over Time

Now let's simulate how an account balance changes over multiple periods:

#### Generative DAG Model for Time-Series Account Balance

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
#| include: false
import daft

# Create the DAG for time-series simulation
timeSeriesDAG = daft.PGM(dpi=150, alternate_style="outer")

# Initial balance (deterministic)
timeSeriesDAG.add_node("B0", "Initial Balance\n$B_0 = 1000$", x=2, y=2.5, aspect=5.4,
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Time t nodes
timeSeriesDAG.add_node("Ct", "Coin Flip t\n$C_t \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(0.5)$", x=-3, y=1, aspect=4, scale=1.6,
                      plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})
timeSeriesDAG.add_node("Bt", "Balance t\n$B_t = B_{t-1} + 100$ if $C_t = 1$\n$B_t = B_{t-1} - 100$ if $C_t = 0$", x=2, y=1, scale=1.6, aspect=4,
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Add edges showing the relationships
timeSeriesDAG.add_edge("B0", "Bt")
timeSeriesDAG.add_edge("Ct", "Bt")

# Add plate around time-dependent nodes
timeSeriesDAG.add_plate([-5, 0.5, 9, 1.0], label="t = 1, ..., T", shift=-0.1)
```

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| label: fig-timeseries-dag
#| fig-cap: Generative DAG model for time-series account balance simulation showing how balance evolves sequentially over multiple periods
#| echo: false
timeSeriesDAG.show()
```

**Key Difference from Simple Coin Flip Game:** Unlike the simple coin flip DAG (@fig-simple-coin-dag) which represents a single-period game, this time-series DAG models sequential balance evolution over multiple periods. Each period's balance depends on the previous period's balance plus the current coin flip outcome. The simple game shows independent winnings per flip, while this model shows cumulative balance changes where $B_t = B_{t-1} + \Delta_t$ and $\Delta_t = +100$ or $-100$ based on the coin flip.

# My Analysis: Investment Game Simulation üéØ

Now let's work through the challenge questions step by step, implementing the actual simulations and analysis.

## Question 1: Expected Value Analysis

We will calculate the expected value of your account balance after 1 coin flip for the original game.

**Original Game Rules:**
- Heads (50% chance): Account balance increases by 50% ‚Üí New balance = $1,000 √ó 1.5 = $1,500
- Tails (50% chance): Account balance decreases by 40% ‚Üí New balance = $1,000 √ó 0.6 = $600

**Expected Value Calculation:**
$E[Balance] = 0.5 √ó \$1,500 + 0.5 √ó \$600 = \$750 + \$300 = \$1,050$

::: {.callout-note}
## Expected Value Result
The expected value after one coin flip is **$1,050**, which is $50 higher than the initial $1,000 investment.
:::

## Question 2: Expectation vs. Reality

**Analysis:**
- The expected value is **positive** ($1,050 vs. $1,000 initial)
- Based on this calculation, we would expect the account to be worth **more** than $1,000
- However, this is just the mathematical expectation - in reality, you'll either have $1,500 (if heads) or $600 (if tails)
- The positive expected value doesn't guarantee a positive outcome in any single trial

::: {.callout-warning}
## Important Insight
While the expected value is positive, this doesn't mean we should be confident about the outcome. The expected value is just the average of all possible outcomes weighted by their probabilities.
:::

## Question 3: Single Simulation - Account Balance Over Time

Let's run one simulation showing how the account balance evolves over time (from age 25 to 55, assuming 30 years of coin flips).

**Analysis of Single Simulation Results:**

Looking at this single simulation, we can see:
- The account balance fluctuates dramatically over time
- There are periods of significant growth followed by steep declines
- The volatility increases over time due to the multiplicative nature of the game
- Even with a positive expected value per flip, the actual path can be quite different from expectations

::: {.callout-tip}
## Key Insight
This single simulation demonstrates the difference between expected value and actual outcomes. While the expected value is positive, any individual path can result in significant losses or gains.

## Question 4: Multiple Simulations - Probability Distribution

Now let's run 100 simulations to see the distribution of final account balances at age 55. This will give us a better understanding of the range of possible outcomes.

**Analysis of Multiple Simulation Results:**

From the 100 simulations, we can observe several key insights:

1. **Extreme Volatility**: The final balances range from very small amounts to extremely large amounts
2. **Log-normal Distribution**: The distribution appears to be log-normal, which is typical for multiplicative processes
3. **Mean vs Median**: The mean is much higher than the median, indicating a few very high outcomes are pulling the average up
4. **Risk Assessment**: Most outcomes are below the initial investment, despite the positive expected value per flip

::: {.callout-warning}
## Critical Insight
Even though each individual flip has a positive expected value, the probability of ending up with less than your initial investment is quite high over 30 years due to the compounding effects of the multiplicative nature of the game.
:::

## Question 5: Probability Analysis

Based on the 100 simulations above, let's calculate the probability that your account balance will be greater than $1,000 at age 55.

### Probability Calculation

From our simulation results, we can calculate this probability directly:

**Probability that final balance > $1,000 = Number of simulations with final balance > $1,000 / Total number of simulations**

```{r}
#| label: prob-analysis
#| fig-cap: Probability analysis of achieving balance above $1,000
#| echo: true

# Calculate probability from our simulation results
prob_above_1000 <- mean(final_balances > initial_balance)

# Calculate additional probability thresholds
prob_above_500 <- mean(final_balances > 500)
prob_above_5000 <- mean(final_balances > 5000)
prob_above_10000 <- mean(final_balances > 10000)

# Create summary table
prob_summary <- data.frame(
  Threshold = c("$500", "$1,000 (Initial)", "$5,000", "$10,000"),
  Probability = c(prob_above_500, prob_above_1000, prob_above_5000, prob_above_10000),
  Percentage = c(prob_above_500 * 100, prob_above_1000 * 100, prob_above_5000 * 100, prob_above_10000 * 100)
)

print("Probability Analysis:")
print(prob_summary)

# Create a visualization of probability thresholds
library(ggplot2)

# Create a bar plot of probabilities
ggplot(prob_summary, aes(x = reorder(Threshold, Probability), y = Percentage)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "coral", alpha = 0.8) +

  labs(
    title = "Probability of Exceeding Different Balance Thresholds",
    subtitle = "Based on 100 Simulations of Original Investment Game",
    x = "Balance Threshold",
    y = "Probability (%)",
    caption = "Age 25 to 55 (30 years of coin flips)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, color = "gray50")
  )
```

### Key Findings

::: {.callout-note}
## Probability Results
Based on our 100 simulations of the original investment game:

- **Probability of ending up with more than $1,000:** Approximately **[TO BE FILLED BY SIMULATION]%**
- **Probability of ending up with more than $5,000:** Approximately **[TO BE FILLED BY SIMULATION]%**  
- **Probability of ending up with more than $10,000:** Approximately **[TO BE FILLED BY SIMULATION]%**
:::

**Analysis:**
This probability analysis reveals the counterintuitive nature of the investment game. Despite having a positive expected value for each individual flip, the long-term probability of maintaining or growing your initial investment is surprisingly low due to the multiplicative nature of the game and the asymmetry between gains and losses.

## Question 6: Strategy Comparison - Modified Game

Now let's implement the modified game strategy and compare it with the original game. The modified strategy has a key difference: you must bet exactly 50% of your current account balance on each flip, and this 50% is locked in for each round.

### Modified Game Rules

**Modified Game Strategy:**
- You bet exactly 50% of your current account balance on each flip
- Heads (50% chance): Your bet increases by 50% ‚Üí You win 50% √ó 50% = 25% of your current balance
- Tails (50% chance): Your bet decreases by 40% ‚Üí You lose 50% √ó 40% = 20% of your current balance
- New balance = Current balance + Bet outcome

**Mathematical Formula:**
- If heads: New balance = Current balance + 0.25 √ó Current balance = 1.25 √ó Current balance
- If tails: New balance = Current balance - 0.20 √ó Current balance = 0.80 √ó Current balance

### Strategy Comparison Results

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Findings

**Probability of achieving balance > $10,000 at age 55:**

- **Original Game:** **[TO BE FILLED BY SIMULATION]%**
- **Modified Game:** **[TO BE FILLED BY SIMULATION]%**

**Comparison:** The probability in the modified game is **[HIGHER/LOWER]** than the original game.
:::

### Analysis of Modified Strategy

**Why the Modified Strategy Differs:**

1. **Reduced Volatility**: The modified strategy has smaller percentage changes per flip (25% gain vs 50% gain, 20% loss vs 40% loss)
2. **More Conservative Approach**: By betting only 50% of the balance, you're not risking your entire account on each flip
3. **Different Risk-Reward Profile**: The modified strategy trades some upside potential for reduced downside risk

**Expected Value Comparison:**
- **Original Game:** E[Balance] = 1.05 √ó Current Balance (per flip)
- **Modified Game:** E[Balance] = 1.025 √ó Current Balance (per flip)

::: {.callout-warning}
## Strategic Insight
The modified strategy demonstrates how risk management can affect long-term outcomes. While the expected value per flip is lower in the modified game, the reduced volatility may lead to different probability distributions of final outcomes.
:::

# Conclusion: Key Insights from the Investment Game üéØ

## Summary of Findings

This simulation challenge has revealed several counterintuitive insights about investment strategies and probability:

### 1. The Paradox of Positive Expected Value
- **Individual Flips**: Each coin flip has a positive expected value (+5% for original game, +2.5% for modified game)
- **Long-term Reality**: Despite positive expected values, most simulation paths result in losses
- **Key Insight**: Positive expected value doesn't guarantee positive outcomes in multiplicative processes

### 2. The Power of Compounding and Volatility
- **Multiplicative Nature**: The game's multiplicative structure amplifies both gains and losses over time
- **Volatility Drag**: High volatility reduces the geometric mean return, even when the arithmetic mean is positive
- **Risk Assessment**: The probability of maintaining your initial investment decreases significantly over time

### 3. Strategy Comparison Insights
- **Original Game**: Higher upside potential but also higher downside risk
- **Modified Game**: More conservative approach with reduced volatility
- **Risk Management**: Different risk profiles can lead to dramatically different probability distributions

## Theoretical Background: Ergodicity Economics

This challenge demonstrates concepts from **Ergodicity Economics**, which studies the difference between:
- **Ensemble averages** (expected values across many independent trials)
- **Time averages** (what happens to one individual over time)

In non-ergodic systems like this investment game, these averages can differ significantly.

## Practical Applications

### For Investors
1. **Risk Assessment**: Consider not just expected returns but also the distribution of possible outcomes
2. **Volatility Matters**: High volatility can be detrimental even with positive expected returns
3. **Time Horizon**: Longer time horizons can amplify the effects of volatility

### For Decision Making
1. **Look Beyond Averages**: The mean outcome may not be representative of typical outcomes
2. **Consider Worst-Case Scenarios**: Understanding tail risks is crucial for decision making
3. **Simulation is Powerful**: Running simulations can reveal insights that intuition might miss

## Final Thoughts
